# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis Project** for a **Booking Management System**.

This repository is designed to simulate a real-world software development scenario by focusing on the crucial **Requirement Analysis** phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The goal is to practice and master the techniques used in gathering, analyzing, documenting, and visualizing requirements to create a strong foundation for successful project execution.

Through a series of structured tasks, this project will guide learners through identifying functional and non-functional requirements, building use case diagrams using tools like Draw.io, defining acceptance criteria, and producing high-quality documentation that aligns with industry standards.

This project is ideal for developers, analysts, or students who want hands-on experience in transforming ideas into clear, actionable requirements that support scalable and effective software solutions.

Stay tuned as each section of this repository will evolve with more documentation, diagrams, and learning insights as we progress through the project steps.
